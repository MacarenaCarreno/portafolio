                  I am a Bachelor of science and engineering in industrial
                  engineering, and Software Developer.
                  <br /> During my time as an Industrial Engineer, I worked in
                  process optimization and data analysis across industries, that
                  included mining, healthcare, mobile, and construction.
                  <br />
                  <br />I have been working as a freelancer for the last 3
                  years, that is why I created a small company called Chagual
                  Technologies, where I helped small and midsize companies in
                  process optimization, and as a result of that, I had to
                  develop and implement software and websites, that was my Aha!
                  moment and decide to pursue the path of Software Developer.
                  <br />
                  <br /> In May 2019 I graduated from Fullstack Academy of Code
                  (Grace Hopper Program) and currently looking for new
                  opportunities in New York City.
                  <br />
                  Now, I mix my knowledge in Processes Optimization and the
                  Fullstack.
